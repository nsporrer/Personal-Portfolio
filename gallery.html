                        on creating consistent and nice looking icons and graphs to illustrate a lot of information
                        about the country. I chose to base my design on the Māori flag, which is the flag that
                        represents the indigenous people of the region.</p>

                        on the word “Inspiration”. The cover is a photo with sketches that inspire me behind a computer
                        that is
                        in the process of designing. The back of the card contains the where, when, and who of the event

                        the
